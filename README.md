## Introduction

This project analyzes the **Credit Score Dataset** to explore relationships between financial features and credit scores. The goal is to understand key patterns that may influence creditworthiness and set the foundation for building a predictive model. The dataset consists of various financial metrics which are analyzed to help predict the credit score of individuals. The analysis focuses on understanding feature correlations, handling missing data, and providing useful visual insights.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Load and Inspect the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/content/credit_score.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())

# Get basic information about the dataset
print(data.info())
```

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This step handles non-numeric columns and performs basic data cleaning.

```python
# Handling non-numeric columns
numeric_data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

# Print columns that were dropped
print("Non-numeric columns dropped:", set(data.columns) - set(numeric_data.columns))
```

### Step 3: Correlation Matrix Visualization

We generate a correlation matrix to explore relationships between financial features.

```python
# Correlation Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
corr_matrix = numeric_data.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a **Credit Score** dataset containing various financial features. It helps predict an individual's creditworthiness. The dataset includes both numeric and categorical variables, and missing data is handled during preprocessing.

You can download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/conorsully1/credit-score).

## Analysis Overview

1. **Data Inspection**: The dataset is first loaded and basic information is extracted using `data.info()` and `data.describe()` to understand the structure and check for missing data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Non-numeric columns are handled and numeric features are selected for further analysis.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: A heatmap is generated to visualize the correlation between numerical features and help understand relationships that might influence credit score prediction.

## Results

### Correlation Matrix

The heatmap visualizes the relationships between various features. Strong correlations can indicate variables that are closely related and may help in predicting the credit score.

- Features that are highly correlated can provide insights into which factors might influence an individualâ€™s creditworthiness.
